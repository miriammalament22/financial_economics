# Advanced Portfolio Optimization and Performance Analysis

This repository is dedicated to advanced financial modeling and portfolio optimization techniques, specifically for equities within the S&P 500 universe. It includes implementations of modern portfolio theory and factor models, providing a comparative analysis of various portfolio types against benchmark equity funds. Developed as part of **Advanced Topics in Finance 2022**, this project combines theoretical rigor with real-world applications, leveraging popular financial tools and data analysis methods in Python, R, MATLAB, and VBA.

## Project Overview

This project explores sophisticated portfolio optimization techniques and factor models applied to the S&P 500, one of the most widely followed stock indices in global markets. It includes:
- **Portfolio Construction**: Developing customized portfolios from S&P 500 stocks, with constraints based on sector representation.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Using historical data to optimize portfolios for minimum variance and maximum Sharpe ratio, both with traditional methods and factor models.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Comparing optimized portfolios to leading equity funds, such as ETFs and Mutual Funds, to evaluate relative performance.

This repository is designed to provide finance professionals, quantitative analysts, and researchers with code and methodologies to implement and customize portfolio optimization and performance evaluation.

## Repository Structure

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks showcasing step-by-step analysis, including data retrieval, portfolio optimization, and visualization.
- **scripts/**: Script files for reproducible analysis, enabling users to quickly adapt the code for other datasets or objectives.
- **data/**: Folder to store processed datasets, ensuring the code can be run without external dependencies (note: raw data should be downloaded from authorized providers).
- **report/**: Final report with detailed explanations of the methodologies, insights on optimization results, and graphical comparisons.

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Portfolio Optimization
   - **Minimum Global Variance Portfolio**: Calculate the portfolio with the least risk based on historical covariance.
   - **Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio**: Optimize for maximum return per unit of risk, a widely used metric in financial analysis.
   - **Factor Model Integration**: Apply multifactor models to adjust risk estimates and improve portfolio allocation accuracy.

### 2. Real-World Performance Benchmarking
   - Compare the optimized portfolios against market-tracking funds (ETFs/Mutual Funds) that benchmark against the S&P 500.
   - Evaluate performance metrics such as return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio over time to determine competitive positioning.

### 3. Dynamic Portfolio Rebalancing
   - Rebalance the portfolio quarterly, allowing flexibility in asset selection while maintaining sector diversity. This simulates real-world portfolio management practices and adapts to market conditions.

## Data Sources

- **S&P 500 Components**: Obtain a time-series dataset of S&P 500 components from 2010 through Q1 2022, ensuring historical accuracy in portfolio construction.
- **Stock Prices**: Historical price data for selected S&P 500 stocks, from 2010 to Q2 2022, to be used for backtesting.
- **Benchmark Funds**: Price data for at least three equity funds (ETFs or Mutual Funds) using the S&P 500 as a benchmark.

## Usage

This repository is structured to allow easy customization and adaptation to other financial datasets or indices. Users can run the code directly or modify parameters for alternative analyses.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/advanced-portfolio-optimization.git
   ### Run Notebooks or Scripts

2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` or `scripts/` folder and run the analysis files.
3. Ensure dependencies are installed (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` for Python).

### Generate Reports

- Compile the analysis and visualizations into a final report for in-depth review.
